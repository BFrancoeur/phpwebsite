# phpwebsite
A modern website with login, mobile optimization, and more.

#PURPOSE
This website is the first phase of a larger project, which is an MVC framework for this website. 

#MISSION
To demonstrate my PHP skills through the integration of the MVC framework, using best practices with the latest version of PHP (8.4 at the time of this writing).

#GOAL
To create multiple portfolio pieces within the scope of a handful of projects that demonstrate proficiency with:
- Modern website architecture
- Technologies commonly used to create websites including, but not limited to:
  - Composer
  - PHP Frameworks
    - Laravel
    - CakePHP
  - Node
    - NPM
    - Yarn
-   JavaScript
-   HTML
-   CSS
-   APIs
-   MySQL
      CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) data
      Queries
-   PHPMyAdmin
  
#NOTE: This README will serve as a journal of my journey from building a website from scratch, to the creation and integration 
of an MVC framework that I'll create a bit later, and ultimately two other projects where the website is integrated into Laravel and CakePHP.
